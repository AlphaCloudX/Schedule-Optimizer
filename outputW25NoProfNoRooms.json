Students will derive  an understanding of the biological foundation of  their own health as an adult and will be  encouraged to expand the concepts and processes  of individual health to human populations,  animals and the environment. Through lectures,  laboratories, small group tutorials and an  individual research project, students will gain  an introduction to research in the health  sciences. Students lacking Grade 12 or 4U Biology  should consult with their program counsellor  prior to taking BIOL*1080 in first semester.  ",

By relating these concepts to  their daily lives, through analysis of problems  and tutorial discussions, students will develop  an understanding of five central themes: 1) all  living things share common properties, 2) the  cell is the fundamental functional unit of life,  3) managing energy is central to success, 4)  genes are the fundamental information unit of  life, and 5) heredity. Students lacking Grade 12  or 4U Biology should consult with their program  counsellor prior to taking BIOL*1090 in first  semester. ",

Emphasis will be on testing  ecological theory with quantitative analysis of  empirical data, thereby gaining greater depth of  understanding of ecological processes at the  population, community and ecosystem scales.  Through the examination of case studies, students  will apply ecological knowledge and quantitative  analysis to problem solving in areas such as  resource management, conservation of populations  and communities, and predicting biosphere  responses to climate change.

In addition to  introducing the various manufacturing process,  mathematical models and several empirical data  and equations describing the various  manufacturing processes will be covered in order  to provide the students with a better  understanding of the relations between the  parameters involved.

Design teams (frequently crossing engineering disciplines) define a problem of modest complexity, with attention to the benefits and risks to users, the environment and society. Students learn and apply methods for idea generation, evaluation of design alternatives and refinement of solutions, which may include a preliminary simulation or software analysis. Technical writing emphasizes revision for clarity and cohesion. Students learn to develop evidence-based arguments and apply this to defend design solutions in terms of primary function, safety, economics, and environmental and societal risks and benefits. Team skills including leadership, interdisciplinary collaboration and conflict resolution are further developed. Project management, in the context of bringing together time, money and people, is practiced. Students reflect and receive feedback on their design process to foster growth in areas including lifelong learning, teamwork, project management and professional behaviour. ",

Topics include modeling in  time and frequency domains (including linear time  invariance, causality, and linearization);  sketching and interpreting Bode plots; stability  of closed loop systems (including analysis via  Routh Hurwitz and Nyquist); performance metrics  including gain and phase margin, sensitivity, and  error tracking; and control using ON/OFF, PID,  root locus, and frequency domain (lead/lag)  techniques. Computer tools to aid in control  design and analysis are a crucial component of  the course. Optional advanced topics include but  are not limited to state-space control,  performance limitations, and control of  non-linear systems. ",

Performance and stability parameters will be  illustrated with root locus diagrams. Control by  on/off and proportional (and its advanced  variants) controllers will be applied to feedback  control problems including regulating physical  and chemical properties, and biological and  chemical reactions. This course includes  experimental process control laboratory work and  use of controller modeling software.  ",

The  course provides an introduction to insect  sampling, observation, identification, and  experimentation in field settings. Student  activities are divided equally between observing,  collecting and identifying specimens from more  than 20 families and an experimental component  involving one or more studies to test hypotheses  about the ecology or behaviour of insects. There  are occasional lectures and discussions to  highlight particularly interesting observations  of insects. Student evaluation is based on the  student's insect collection and associated  logbook, a written paper describing their  experiment, contributions to class discussions  and activities, and peer evaluation. The field  site is generally in the USA or South America.  Course fees cover costs of room, board, supplies,  and transportation to the field site(s). This  course must be recorded as part of the student's  Fall or Winter course selection and tuition and  compulsory fees will be calculated accordingly.  Detailed information is available from the Office  of the Director - School of Environmental  Sciences. ",

The faculty member can be from any department at the University, so long as the project falls within the field of neuroscience. Projects involve original research communicated in oral presentations and in written reports, including a publication quality final report. This two-semester course offers students the opportunity to pursue research questions and experimental designs that cannot be completed in the single semester research courses. Students must make arrangements with a faculty supervisor and submit a completed registration questionnaire to the course coordinator before registering for this course. This two-semester course is offered over consecutive semesters. Students will select NEUR*4421 in the first semester and NEUR*4422 in the second semester. A grade will not be assigned to NEUR*4421 until NEUR*4422 has been completed. ",

What  are the roles of reason and emotion in ethics? Is  morality grounded on a principle, and if so, what  is it? Are there any traits of character that one  must have to be a good person? Given that  traditional ethical codes have been almost  universally sexist, how must ethics be  refashioned in order for women to achieve equal  recognition? ",
